# üé≠ Emotion Detector using OpenCV

## üéØ Project Overview
This project is a Python-based real-time facial emotion detection system utilizing OpenCV. It employs a pre-trained model to classify emotions based on facial expressions captured via webcam or static images. The application can be used for a variety of purposes, such as mood tracking, enhancing user interactions, or simply experimenting with computer vision techniques.

## üì¶ Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For capturing and processing video frames.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing images and results (if needed).
- **Keras**: For loading and using the pre-trained emotion detection model.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib keras
```

## ü§ñ Model
The project uses a pre-trained emotion detection model that identifies various emotions from facial expressions. You can replace this model with your custom-trained model to improve accuracy or adapt it to specific use cases.

## üé® User Interface
The application features a modern, minimalist web interface built with HTML5 and CSS3:
- **Glass-morphism Design**: A sleek, translucent container that houses the video feed
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple buttons for starting and stopping the camera
- **Real-time Display**: Shows detected emotions immediately below the video feed
- **Custom Background**: Features a subtle, animated background that doesn't interfere with the main functionality

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
- **Emotion Labels**: Adjust the labels in the script to align with your model's output categories.
- **Image Processing**: Modify the code to work with static images if video frame processing is not needed.
- **Additional Features**: Consider implementing features like emotion tracking over time or detailed emotion analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **Accuracy**: The emotion detection accuracy relies heavily on the quality of the pre-trained model and optimal lighting conditions. Consider retraining the model with more diverse datasets to improve performance.
- **Webcam Compatibility**: The script might have compatibility issues with certain webcam devices. Ensure that your webcam drivers are up to date and test with different devices if needed.
